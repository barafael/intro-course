setup:

expressions vs. statements:
    ````rust tag:playground-button playground-before:$"fn main() {\n"$ playground-after:$"}"$ playground-indent
    let age = 4;
    age++;
    ````
    Why is `++` not a thing in Rust?

move semantics:
re-bindings and why they are idiomatic

borrowing:
    Even when the value is a reference, an immutable binding still means the value cannot be changed.

    Do these compile? If not, why?

    ````rust tag:playground-button playground-wrap:main
    let a = 1;
    let b = 5;
    let ref_a = &a;
    ref_a = &b;
    *ref_a = b;
    ````
    
error handling:
let-else
if let
handy patterns in bindings

strings:
    format
